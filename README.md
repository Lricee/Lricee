# Astronomy Domine

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground

Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda
And Titania, Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam, pow, pow

Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground

Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground
